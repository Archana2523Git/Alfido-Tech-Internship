# Alfido Tech Internship
# ✅ Task 2 – Machine Learning Classification using Decision Tree & Logistic Regression
👩‍💻 Alfido Tech AI Internship – Archana Sarella

## 📌 Objective
To build, train, and evaluate classification models using:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression

This task demonstrates how to use machine learning for predictive modeling using real-world datasets and scikit-learn.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Supervised Learning (Classification)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
- Dataset Splitting (Train/Test)
- scikit-learn library usage

## 📂 Files Included
- 📝 `classification_model.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter/Colab notebook that:
  - Loads and explores a dataset (Iris or similar)
  - Trains both Decision Tree & Logistic Regression models
  - Evaluates model accuracy and metrics
  - (Optional) Visualizes the decision tree

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics Used
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score (via Classification Report)

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional for tree visualization)

## 🚀 Outcome
Successfully trained and evaluated two machine learning classifiers using scikit-learn. Demonstrated the ability to preprocess data, build models, and interpret results effectively.
